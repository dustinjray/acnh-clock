# Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Bugs, Fish, and Sea Creature Clock

[The Clock](https://dustinjray.github.io/acnh-clock)
## Inspiration

I saw a recommendation to create a clock as an early JavaScript project, but that seemed boring. I decided to expand upon that suggestion by making it into a tool for a game I like to play. 

It's easy to find lists of the collectible creatures available during a given month, but the creatures for the ENTIRE day are listed, along with the times they are available. This clock only shows the creatures that are available on your island right this second.

## How to Use

### Creatures
Clicking on any one of the buttons at the bottom will open a modal that contains the name, location (or creature speed), and the standard selling price of each creature.
### Music
Clicking the music note icon in the corner will turn the music on, clicking again will turn it off.

## Features/Fun Facts
I don't know that it's really what I would call a "feature" but there are a couple of things I incorporated into the clock just to add a little character.
### Background Images
The background images are based on time of day and screen size.
### Background Music
The music that plays will be music from the Animal Crossing game, matching the hour that it currently is. There are three different types of music that can play every hour, something like "sunny", "rainy", and... something else. In any case, it randomly picks one of those when you ask for music.
