# Animal Crossing Bug, Fish, Sea Creature Clock

So I saw a reccomendation to create a clock as an early JavaScript project and I decided to expand upon that suggestion a little bit.

This clock will tell you what bugs, fish, and sea creatures are available on your Animal Crossing: New Horizons island right at this exact moment, instead of what creatures are available this month. 

This clock utilizes the ACNH API which can be found at: http://acnhapi.com

The music icon in the corner uses the same API to play a random background music for the current hour from the game (so Sunny, Rainy, or Snowy). The music is off by default.

The background images change based on time of day and screen width. The photos come from various photographers on unsplash and the credits may be found below:
